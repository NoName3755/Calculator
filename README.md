#This is a practice calculator that I used https://codescracker.com/python/program/python-program-make-calculator.htm as a reference for. 
#I am uploading it to GitHub for the purpose of trying to learn the GitHub process for uploading in the future.
#I don't know if anyone will even read this but if I did anything wrong I'd really appreciate any advice so I can learn.
